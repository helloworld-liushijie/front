        Trump tweets that he is delaying this weekend’s ICE deportation raids for 2 weeks
        By COLLEEN LONG  and LISA MASCARO

        President Donald Trump on Saturday delayed a nationwide immigration sweep to deport people living in the United States illegally, including families, saying he would give lawmakers two weeks to work out solutions for the southern border.
        
        Additionally, during a question-and-answer session with media on Saturday, Trump brought Chicago into the mix, saying Chicago is one of several “high crime’’ cities that are “fighting,’’ the sweep.
        
        
        The move came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump on Friday asking him to call off the raids. But three administration officials said scrapping the operation was not just about politics. They said Immigration and Customs Enforcement leaders had expressed serious concerns that officers’ safety would be in jeopardy because too many details about the raids had been made public.
        
        The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to speak about private discussions.

        “At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “If not, Deportations start!”
        
        At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border. If not, Deportations start!
        
        — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2019
        The operation, which sparked outrage and concern among immigrant advocates, had been expected to begin Sunday and would target people with final orders of removal, including families whose immigration cases had been fast-tracked by judges.
        
        The cancellation was another sign of the Trump administration’s difficulty managing the border. The number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has risen dramatically under Trump, despite his tough rhetoric and hard-line policies. Balancing a White House eager to push major operational changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge for the Department of Homeland Security.
        
        Trump gave the first public word of the planned sweep earlier this week, saying in a tweet that an operation was coming up and the agency would begin to remove "millions" of people who were in the United States illegally. Later, leaks to the media included sensitive law enforcement details, such as the day it was to begin, Sunday, plus specific cities and other operational details.
        
        Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in. Mexico, using their strong immigration laws, is doing a very good job of stopping people.......
        
        — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2019
        On Saturday, ICE spokeswoman Carol Danko criticized the leaks in context of their potential impact on ICE personnel, saying in a statement that “any leaks telegraphing sensitive law enforcement operations is egregious and puts our officers’ safety in danger.”
        
        On his way to Camp David on Saturday, Trump told reporters on the White House south lawn that “some cities are going to fight it, but if you notice, they’re generally high crime cities."

        "If you look at Chicago, they’re fighting it. If you look at other cities, they’re fighting it. Many of those cities are high crime cities and they’re sanctuary cities,” Trump said. “People are tired of sanctuary cities and what it does and the crime it brings.”
        
        Pelosi called Trump on Friday night and the two spoke for about 12 minutes, according to a person familiar with the situation and not authorized to discuss it publicly. She asked him to call off the raids and he said he would consider the request, the person said.
        
        It’s unclear what else was said during the call. But in a statement Saturday before the president’s decision was announced, Pelosi appealed to the same compassion Trump expressed in declining to strike Iran because of the potential for lost lives.
        
        "The President spoke about the importance of avoiding the collateral damage of 150 lives in Iran. I would hope he would apply that same value to avoiding the collateral damage to tens of thousands of children who are frightened by his actions," she said.
        
        She called the raids "heartless."

        Pelosi responded to Trump's announcement with her own tweet, saying: "Mr. President, delay is welcome. Time is needed for comprehensive immigration reform. Families belong together."
        
        Halting the flow of illegal immigration has been Trump's signature campaign issue, but Congress has been unable to push his proposals into law with resistance from both Democrats and Republicans. Bipartisan talks over the immigration system have started and stalled but are again underway among some in the Senate.
        
        Lawmakers are considering whether to give $4.6 billion in emergency funding to help border agencies struggling to manage a growing number of migrants crossing the border. The measure passed a Senate committee on a 30-1 vote. But the House is considering its own measure. Funding is running out and Congress is trying to approve legislation before the House and Senate recess next week.
        
        Earlier Saturday, Trump hinted the operation was still on, saying the people ICE was looking for "have already been ordered to be deported."
        
        "This means that they have run from the law and run from the courts," Trump said.
        
        Coordinated enforcement operations take months to plan . Surprise is also an important element. ICE officers don’t have a search warrant and are working from files with addresses and must go to people’s home and ask to be let inside. Immigrants are not required to open their doors, and increasingly they don’t. Officers generally capture about 30% to 40% of targets.
        
        The planned operation was heavily criticized by Democratic lawmakers as cruel, and many local mayors said they would refuse to cooperate with ICE. Immigrant advocates stepped up know-your-rights campaigns.
        
        Another complication is that ICE needs travel paperwork from a home country to deport someone, so immigrants often end up detained at least temporarily waiting for a flight. ICE was reserving hotel rooms for families in the event the operation went off as planned Sunday.
        
        The adult population of detainees was 53,141 as of June 8, though the agency is only budgeted for 45,000. There were 1,662 in family detention, also at capacity, and one of the family detention centers is currently housing single adults.

        7 bikers die after pickup truck collides with group of 10 motorcycles on rural New Hampshire highway

        | RANDOLPH, N.H.
          
        7 bikers die after pickup truck collides with group of 10 motorcycles on rural New Hampshire highway
        This photo provided by Miranda Thompson shows the scene where several motorcycles and a pickup truck collided on a rural, two-lane highway Friday, June 21, 2019, in Randolph, N.H. (AP)
        Investigators pleaded Saturday for members of the public to come forward with information that could help them determine why a pickup truck hauling a trailer collided with a group of 10 motorcycles on a rural highway, killing seven bikers.
        
        The crash in remote northern New Hampshire involved members of Marine JarHeads, a motorcycle club that includes Marines and their spouses, authorities said. The tragedy sent shockwaves through New England's communities of motorcyclists and military veterans, which often overlap.
        
        "When something like this happens, we all feel it," said Cat Wilson, who organizes a motorcycle charity event in Massachusetts and is a friend of some of the crash victims. "There is no tighter community than our biker community."
        
        Authorities identified the pickup driver as Volodoymyr Zhukovskyy, 23, an employee of a Springfield, Massachusetts, company called Westfield Transport.
        
        Zhukovskyy survived the accident, did not need to be hospitalized and has not been charged, authorities said, but they didn't address details on his whereabouts. A phone listing for him couldn't be found.
        
        [Most read] The bizarre Jussie Smollett case takes yet another strange twist »
        Dartanyan Gasanov, the owner of Westfield Transport, told The Boston Globe that he planned to talk to investigators Monday and has been unable to reach Zhukovskyy, who has not been answering phone calls.
        
        The National Transportation Safety Board is among the agencies investigating. Authorities asked for the public's help in the form of videos, photos or other information about the accident or the vehicles involved.
        
        "This is one of the worst tragic incidents that we have investigated here in the state," New Hampshire State Police Col. Chris Wagner said at a Saturday news conference in nearby Lancaster. "It's going to be a very lengthy investigation."
        
        A black 2016 Dodge 2500 pickup truck towing a flatbed trailer of the kind used to haul cars collided with the bikers around 6:30 p.m. Friday on U.S. 2, a two-lane highway in Randolph, police said. Randolph is about a two-hour drive north of Concord, the capital, and a three-hour drive from Boston.
        
        Along with the seven dead, state police said, three people were taken to hospitals. Two of them were released Saturday. Police did not provide names of the injured or dead but said they could release the names of victims as early as Sunday.
        
        [Most read] The Rolling Stones review: A rejuvenated Mick Jagger leads the band at Soldier Field »
        The road reopened Saturday, when skid marks were still visible for several hundred feet on the road, which has mountains and fields full of wildflowers as a backdrop. Nothing was left of the broken motorcycles, but a patch of burned grass and tire marks in the mud remained.
        
        For much the day, residents and bikers stopped by to pay respects. Some prayed, reminisced about their own close calls or planted American flags.
        
        Bill Brown, a 73-year-old Vietnam veteran and motorcyclist, arrived at the scene near a gentle curve in the road to put down flags, calling the victims "brothers in arms," vowing to keep riding and expressing shock.
        
        "Seven people. C'mon. It's senseless," he said. "Somebody made a mistake, and it turned out to be pretty deadly."
        
        Down the road, over a dozen members of the Marine JarHeads gathered at a motel. Dressed in motorcycle jackets with "JarHeads" written on the back, they hugged one another and wept. Earlier in the day, they prayed with a pastor.
        
        [Most read] Editorial: Getting to truth, finally, of Kim Foxx and Jussie Smollett »
        Members of the motorcycle community are already organizing help for the victims' families, Wilson said.
        
        A small memorial was held at a church in nearby Berlin on Saturday evening.
        
        On Friday, witnesses described a "devastating" scene as bystanders tried to help riders lying in the road. Broke motorcycles and the bodies of riders littered the highway and the pickup sent off the road and burst into flames.
        
        “There was debris everywhere,” said Miranda Thompson, 21, of Manchester, who was several cars back and recalled seeing a truck in flames on the side of the highway and six motorcycles.
        
        "People were in the grass," she said. "There were people putting tourniquets on people, trying to make sure they didn't move."
        
        Whittle reported from Portland, Maine. Associated Press writer David Sharp in Portland contributed.
        
        This story has been updated to correct that three others were taken to hospitals, not two.
